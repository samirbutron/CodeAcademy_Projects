This little game is a number guessing name, where the user is meant to input a number in the text box and click on "guess". The game will generate a pseudo random number and the player who has the closest guess wins the game.

# TODO 
There is a bug where the buttons may disable after guessing a number that is above 9 or below 0. Execute the game again to return it to a functional state.
